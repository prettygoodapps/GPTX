# GPTX Green AI Ledger

A platform for tracking, managing, and offsetting the carbon footprint of AI workloads, built with FastAPI.

## 🚀 Features

- **AI Carbon Footprint Tracking**: Estimate and monitor the environmental impact of AI.
- **Blockchain-Based Ledger**: A transparent, immutable record of carbon offsets.
- **Carbon Offset Marketplace**: Integration with trusted carbon credit providers.
- **RESTful API**: A comprehensive, documented API for all platform features.
- **Type Safety**: Full type hints and validation with Pydantic.
- **Production Ready**: Built with comprehensive testing, logging, and monitoring.

## 🏗️ Architecture

This project adheres to high-quality code standards with:

- **Python 3.9+** with modern async/await patterns
- **FastAPI** framework for high-performance APIs
- **SQLAlchemy** ORM with PostgreSQL support
- **Pydantic** for data validation and settings management
- **Poetry** for dependency management
- **Comprehensive testing** with pytest and 80%+ coverage
- **Code quality tools** (Black, isort, mypy, flake8, bandit)
- **Pre-commit hooks** for automated quality checks
