# GPTX Project Roadmap

This document outlines the high-level development roadmap for the GPTX Project. The timeline is divided into quarterly milestones, focusing on a phased approach from proof-of-concept to public launch.

## Q3 2025: Proof-of-Concept (POC)
*   **Goal:** Develop and deploy a functional POC on an Ethereum testnet (e.g., Sepolia).
*   **Key Deliverables:**
    *   Implement the core smart contracts: Token Wrapper, Exchange, and Offset Trigger.
    *   Build a minimal frontend for wrapping, trading, and retiring tokens.
    *   Integrate with a simulated carbon offset provider API.
    *   Publish detailed POC results and a public demo.

## Q4 2025: Alpha & Security Audit
*   **Goal:** Prepare for a limited public release by focusing on security and user feedback.
*   **Key Deliverables:**
    *   Conduct a full security audit of the smart contracts with a reputable third-party firm.
    *   Launch a limited Alpha program for early adopters to test the platform on mainnet.
    *   Refine the user interface based on feedback from alpha testers.
    *   Establish the initial framework for the GPTX DAO.

## Q1 2026: Public Beta Launch
*   **Goal:** Open the platform to the public and begin building the community.
*   **Key Deliverables:**
    *   Launch the public beta of the GPTX Exchange.
    *   Implement the initial version of the DAO governance model, allowing token holders to vote on key proposals.
    *   Onboard the first official carbon offset partner.

## Q2 2026: Expansion & Ecosystem Growth
*   **Goal:** Expand the platform's capabilities and grow the ecosystem.
*   **Key Deliverables:**
    *   Integrate with at least two new AI service providers to increase the variety of tokenized assets.
    *   Develop and release an API for third-party developers to build on top of the GPTX platform.
    *   Launch a grants program funded by the DAO treasury to encourage community contributions.
