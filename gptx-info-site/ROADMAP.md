# GPTX Green AI Ledger - Project Roadmap

This document outlines the high-level development roadmap for the GPTX Green AI Ledger Project. The timeline is divided into quarterly milestones, focusing on a phased approach to building a comprehensive AI carbon accountability platform.

## Q3 2025: Carbon Footprint Estimation & API (Phase 1 - Core Focus)
*   **Goal:** Develop and release the core carbon footprint estimation engine and its API.
*   **Key Deliverables:**
    *   Initial carbon emission models for common AI workloads (e.g., training, inference).
    *   RESTful API endpoints for submitting AI workload data and receiving carbon footprint estimates.
    *   Basic data storage for footprint records.
    *   Comprehensive unit and integration tests for the estimation engine.

## Q4 2025: Carbon Offset Integration & Green Ledger POC
*   **Goal:** Integrate with a carbon offset marketplace and establish a Proof-of-Concept for the Green Ledger.
*   **Key Deliverables:**
    *   Integration with at least one reputable carbon offset provider (e.g., Gold Standard, KlimaDAO).
    *   API endpoints for purchasing and retiring carbon offsets.
    *   POC for recording carbon offset transactions on a public blockchain (the "Green Ledger").
    *   Initial reporting and analytics for carbon offset activities.

## Q1 2026: Green Ledger Alpha & Public API
*   **Goal:** Launch an Alpha version of the Green Ledger and make the full API publicly available.
*   **Key Deliverables:**
    *   Deployment of the Green Ledger smart contracts on a testnet (e.g., Sepolia, Polygon Mumbai).
    *   Public API documentation and SDKs for developers to integrate with the GPTX Green AI Ledger.
    *   Alpha program for early adopters to test the end-to-end carbon tracking and offsetting process.
    *   Basic web interface for viewing Green Ledger transactions.

## Q2 2026: Ecosystem Expansion & Advanced Analytics
*   **Goal:** Expand the platform's capabilities and enhance carbon tracking accuracy.
*   **Key Deliverables:**
    *   Integration with additional carbon offset providers and marketplaces.
    *   Advanced AI model analytics for more granular and accurate carbon footprint estimations.
    *   Tools and integrations for major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) to automatically track AI compute usage.
    *   Research and development into new methods for AI carbon reduction.

## Future Vision: Sustainable AI Economy
*   **Long-term Goal:** Build a comprehensive ecosystem for sustainable AI.
*   **Potential Future Deliverables:**
    *   A "Green AI" certification program for models and applications.
    *   A marketplace for sustainable AI products and services.
    *   Exploration of a decentralized exchange for AI credits, with sustainability as a core principle.
    *   DAO governance for the GPTX Green AI Ledger.
