# GPTX Green AI Ledger - Project Plan

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the GPTX Green AI Ledger project, including its purpose, system architecture, and development roadmap.

## 1. Project Overview

**Purpose:** GPTX is a platform for measuring, managing, and offsetting the carbon footprint of AI. Our goal is to foster a sustainable AI ecosystem through transparent and verifiable carbon accountability.

The primary goal is to create a platform that:
*   Provides accurate estimations of the carbon footprint of AI workloads.
*   Offers a seamless way to purchase and retire carbon offsets.
*   Maintains a public, immutable record of all offset activities on a "Green Ledger."

## 2. System Architecture

(The system architecture is detailed in `ARCHITECTURE.md`)

## 3. Development Roadmap

The project will be developed in phases, with the following high-level milestones:

### **Phase 1: Carbon Accountability (Current Focus)**
*   **Goal:** Develop and launch the core carbon tracking and offsetting platform.
*   **Deliverables:**
    *   A robust carbon estimation engine.
    *   Integration with at least one carbon offset marketplace.
    *   A functional Green Ledger on a public blockchain.
    *   A public API for all core features.

### **Future Vision: A Broader Sustainable AI Economy**
*   **Goal:** Expand the platform to become a comprehensive hub for sustainable AI.
*   **Potential Future Deliverables:**
    *   A "Green AI" certification program.
    *   A marketplace for sustainable AI products and services.
    *   Research and development into more efficient and sustainable AI technologies.
    *   Exploration of a decentralized exchange for AI credits, with sustainability as a core principle.
