# 🪙 GPTX + Bitcoin: Unlocking AI Utility with Hard Money

## 🧠 Why We Accept Bitcoin

At GPTX, we believe in **financial sovereignty**, **open ecosystems**, and **sustainable compute**. By allowing users to purchase GPTX credits using **Bitcoin**, we align our mission with the foundational principles of decentralization and user ownership.

Bitcoin isn't just a payment method—it's a **signal of independence**. GPTX empowers users to reclaim value from unused AI tokens, and we see BTC as the natural on-ramp to that liberation.

## 🌍 Carbon-Offset BTC Integration

We’re aware of the environmental concerns around Bitcoin’s energy use. That’s why every Bitcoin purchase through GPTX triggers an **automated carbon offset**, ensuring that **each BTC-based transaction contributes more to sustainability than it consumes**.

> 💚 **2x Offset Guarantee:** For every dollar of GPTX credits purchased via Bitcoin, we fund carbon offsets equal to **twice** the estimated emissions of the transaction.

This makes GPTX the **first AI token platform to turn Bitcoin into a climate-positive transaction layer**.

## 🚀 User Benefits

- 🔓 **Global Access**: No banks, no borders—just utility and ownership.
- 🏷️ **BTC Bonuses**: Pay in BTC and receive a **10% GPTX credit bonus**.
- ♻️ **Clean Compute Promise**: Bitcoin purchases contribute directly to our **green offset ledger**.
- 🔐 **Non-Custodial by Design**: No third-party wallets, no data collection—just your keys and your compute credits.

---

## 💡 How It Works

1. Choose to pay with BTC when purchasing GPTX credits.
2. Our payment engine auto-converts to GPTX using a trusted bridge (Lightning or native Bitcoin).
3. A matching carbon offset donation is made to a verified partner (Gold Standard, KlimaDAO, etc.).
4. You receive GPTX credits + bonus. We record the offset transaction on our **public Green Ledger**.

# 🌱 Bitcoin Sustainability & Carbon Offset Model

## ✅ Is Bitcoin-Based Offset Sustainable?

Yes—**Bitcoin-based carbon offsets can be sustainable and ethical**, provided they are implemented transparently, with accurate modeling and verifiable partners. GPTX’s approach to BTC offsetting is designed to go beyond industry minimums and actively contribute to long-term environmental impact reduction.

---

## ✅ When It *Is* Sustainable

### 1. Use High-Quality Carbon Credits

GPTX will only use offset providers with verifiable, high-integrity projects, such as:

- [Gold Standard](https://www.goldstandard.org/)
- [Verra (VCS)](https://verra.org/)
- [Puro.Earth](https://puro.earth/)
- Web3 carbon protocols (e.g., KlimaDAO, Carbonmark, Toucan)

These providers offer audited, additional, and permanent offset mechanisms.

---

### 2. Accurately Estimate Bitcoin Emissions

GPTX uses established models (e.g., [Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index](https://www.jbs.cam.ac.uk/2025/cambridge-study-sustainable-energy-rising-in-bitcoin-mining/) to estimate the CO₂e per BTC-based transaction, adjusted for:

- **Miner energy mix** (renewables vs fossil)
- **Network-wide energy demand**
- **Transaction type** (on-chain vs Lightning Network)

Lightning transactions have dramatically lower carbon costs and will be prioritized.

---

### 3. Public Offset Ledger

All BTC-based purchases and their associated offsets will be tracked in a **public Green Ledger**, including:

- Timestamped record of BTC payment
- CO₂e estimate
- Offset provider and link to proof/certificate
- Wallet of origin (hashed/anonymized if needed)

Transparency ensures trust.

---

### 4. Real Carbon Drawdown Focus

GPTX favors offsets that **remove** carbon rather than delay emissions:

- ✅ Direct air capture (DAC)
- ✅ Biochar
- ✅ Soil car
