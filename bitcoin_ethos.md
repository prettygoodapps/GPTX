# 🪙 GPTX + Bitcoin: Unlocking AI Utility with Hard Money

## 🧠 Why We Accept Bitcoin

At GPTX, we believe in **financial sovereignty**, **open ecosystems**, and **sustainable compute**. By allowing users to purchase GPTX credits using **Bitcoin**, we align our mission with the foundational principles of decentralization and user ownership.

Bitcoin isn't just a payment method—it's a **signal of independence**. GPTX empowers users to reclaim value from unused AI tokens, and we see BTC as the natural on-ramp to that liberation.

## 🌍 Carbon-Offset BTC Integration

We’re aware of the environmental concerns around Bitcoin’s energy use. That’s why every Bitcoin purchase through GPTX triggers an **automated carbon offset**, ensuring that **each BTC-based transaction contributes more to sustainability than it consumes**.

> 💚 **2x Offset Guarantee:** For every dollar of GPTX credits purchased via Bitcoin, we fund carbon offsets equal to **twice** the estimated emissions of the transaction.

This makes GPTX the **first AI token platform to turn Bitcoin into a climate-positive transaction layer**.
