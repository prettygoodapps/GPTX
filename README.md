# GPTX - The Green AI Ledger

**GPTX** is a platform designed to measure, manage, and mitigate the carbon footprint of artificial intelligence. Our mission is to promote a sustainable AI ecosystem by providing transparent, verifiable, and accessible tools for carbon accountability.

We empower developers, companies, and AI providers to track the environmental impact of their compute usage and offset it through a decentralized, on-chain system.

## 🔥 Why GPTX?

- **Measure & Offset AI's Carbon Footprint** – Understand the environmental impact of AI workloads and take action.
- **Promote Transparency** – Utilize a public, immutable ledger to track carbon offsets and sustainability claims.
- **Incentivize Green Compute** – Reward and recognize AI providers and users who prioritize sustainability.
- **Build a Foundation for a Sustainable AI Economy** – Create the tools needed for environmental, social, and governance (ESG) compliance and leadership in the AI space.

## 🧩 Core Features (Phase 1)

- **AI Carbon Footprint Estimation Engine** – A service to estimate the carbon emissions of AI usage based on model type, hardware, and location.
- **Decentralized Carbon Offset Marketplace** – A system to purchase and retire carbon credits from trusted, verifiable providers (e.g., Gold Standard, KlimaDAO).
- **The Green Ledger** – A public, blockchain-based record of all carbon footprints and their corresponding offsets.
- **ERC-20 GPTX Token** – A utility token for governance, platform fees, and staking in the carbon offset ecosystem.
- **Green AI Certification** – A program to certify AI providers and applications that demonstrate a commitment to carbon neutrality.

## 🌍 Sustainability First

GPTX is built on the principle that technological progress should not come at an unsustainable environmental cost. Our platform helps stakeholders:
- Publicly track and verify their sustainability efforts.
- Demonstrate ESG compliance and environmental leadership.
- Make informed decisions about their AI usage and its impact.

## 📅 Phased Roadmap

### **Phase 1: Carbon Accountability (Current Focus)**
- ✅ MVP Design & Architecture
- 🔜 Develop Carbon Estimation Models for major AI services.
- 🔜 Implement a transparent Carbon Offset Pool/Marketplace.
- 🔜 Launch the Public Green Ledger Explorer.
- 🔜 Release GPTX Governance Token.

### **Future Vision: A Broader Sustainable AI Economy**
- 🏗️ Explore a cross-platform AI service credit exchange, built upon the foundation of our Green Ledger.
- 🏗️ Research token wrapping for unused AI credits as a mechanism to reduce waste.
- 🏗️ Design a full-fledged decentralized AI marketplace where sustainability is a core metric.

## 🤝 Get Involved

We're actively looking for:
- **Backend engineers (Python, FastAPI)**
- **Data scientists (for carbon modeling)**
- **Smart contract developers (Solidity)**
- **Carbon sustainability experts**
- **UX/UI designers**
