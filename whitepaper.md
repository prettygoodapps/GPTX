# GPTX Whitepaper

## 1. Executive Summary

GPTX is a decentralized AI token liquidity platform that enables users to trade unused tokens from subscription-based AI services (such as OpenAI, Anthropic, or Mistral) into a universal token or altcoin. Beyond creating liquidity for otherwise wasted tokens, GPTX integrates a carbon offset incentive model, allowing AI platforms to convert unused token allocations into verifiable carbon offsets, demonstrating sustainability and improving ESG metrics.

## 2. Problem Statement

* **Token Waste**: Users of AI platforms often subscribe to multiple services and rarely use their full token allocations.
* **Siloed Ecosystems**: Tokens are locked within proprietary systems, creating inefficiencies and fragmentation.
* **Environmental Impact**: Overprovisioned compute resources contribute to a latent and unaccounted-for carbon footprint.
* **Lack of Sustainability Visibility**: AI providers lack tooling to claim or verify environmental offsets associated with unused compute.

## 3. GPTX Solution Overview

GPTX enables:

* **Cross-platform token swaps**: Users can trade unused AI tokens across supported providers.
* **Universal token liquidity**: Introduces the GPTX Token (\$GPTX), a utility token for access, fees, governance, and staking.
* **Carbon accountability**: Quantifies and offsets the carbon footprint of unused AI compute, recorded on a public ledger.
* **AI provider incentives**: Platforms can earn carbon credits, badges, and public ESG metrics by contributing unused tokens.

## 4. Technical Architecture

* **Token Wrappers**: Adapter contracts abstract platform-specific tokens.
* **Universal GPTX Coin**: ERC-20 or Layer 2 token serving as the central liquidity unit.
* **Smart Contract Exchange**: AMM or escrow-based mechanism for token swaps.
* **Carbon Estimator Module**: Models carbon equivalent of unused tokens.
* **Offset Pool Contracts**: Token donations fund verifiable carbon offsets.
* **Public Ledger + Dashboard**: Visual explorer of offset impact, GPTX treasury, and platform certifications.

## 5. Token Economics

GPTX Token Use Cases:

* Transaction fees and fee discounts
* Carbon offset contributions and certification access
* Governance voting on partners, treasury, and features
* Premium analytics and developer APIs
* Staking for rewards and priority access

### Fee Distribution:

* 50% to development and protocol treasury
* 25% to verified carbon offset pool
* 25% to community stakers and liquidity providers

### Token Supply and Allocation:

| Allocation | Purpose                   | Notes                      |
| ---------- | ------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| 30%        | Liquidity & user airdrops | On-chain campaigns         |
| 25%        | Ecosystem/Dev Fund        | Multisig or DAO-controlled |
| 20%        | Carbon Offset Treasury    | Offset subsidization       |
| 15%        | Core Contributors         | Vested over 3 years        |
| 10%        | Treasury Reserve          | Emergency and grants       |

## 6. Carbon Offset Integration

* **Estimation Models**: Compute usage per token converted to kWh, then CO2e.
* **Proof of Non-Use**: Token contribution indicates unused compute.
* **Offset Pools**: Partner with Verra, Gold Standard, KlimaDAO.
* **Public Ledger**: Transparency of who contributed and what was offset.
* **Certification**: Platforms can receive "Green AI Verified" badges based on contribution volume and consistency.

## 7. GPTX Token Utility

### 7.1 Overview

GPTX Token (\$GPTX) is a utility and governance token. It is required to:

* Use the exchange with reduced fees
* Participate in carbon offset contributions
* Certify AI platforms with green credentials
* Stake and earn platform rewards
* Vote on governance proposals and treasury use

### 7.2 Core Use Cases

| Utility Category         | Function Description                                              |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Transaction Fee Discount | Reduced fees when holding or staking GPTX                         |
| Carbon Offset Pool       | Portion of swap fees routed to fund offsets                       |
| Platform Certification   | GPTX staked by AI platforms for "Green AI Verified" status        |
| Premium Access           | Access advanced analytics, API endpoints, and partner tools       |
| Governance Voting        | Vote on carbon partners, updates, treasury allocation, and policy |
| Staking & Rewards        | Earn GPTX by staking and contributing liquidity                   |

### 7.3 Incentives & Alignment

* Transparent fee model
* Sustainable treasury mechanisms
* Active role in reducing digital carbon footprint
* Governance-enabled decision making

### 7.4 Future Use Cases

* GPTX-denominated compute payments
* ESG-weighted partner curation and rating
* Integration with AI wallets, Web3 identity, and zero-knowledge proof compliance

## 8. Governance Model

* Phase 1: Core team + multisig treasury
* Phase 2: DAO-lite with proposal/voting system using GPTX token
* Phase 3: Full community governance with on-chain execution and carbon partner whitelisting

## 9. Roadmap

### Phase 1: MVP

* Launch whitepaper, GitHub repo, and GitHub org
* Deploy basic GPTX token (ERC-20) on testnet
* Manual swap UI and early partner onboarding

### Phase 2: Carbon Modules

* Smart contract for offset pool
* Verified partner integrations
* Green Ledger Explorer UI

### Phase 3: Token Launch & Governance

* Airdrop campaign
* DAO-lite staking and proposal voting
* Community onboarding and scaling

## 10. Legal & Compliance

* Terms-of-service risks mitigated by using wrappers or representation contracts
* Trademark application for "GPTX"
* Open-source with Business Source or custom license
* Carbon offsets verified via industry-standard registries

## 11. Monetization Strategy

| Revenue Stream           | Justification                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Swap/transaction fees    | Low-friction and user-aligned                                 |
| Platform certification   | AI platforms benefit from ESG visibility                      |
| Premium analytics/API    | Value-added features for heavy users and integrators          |
| Token staking & rewards  | Rewards ecosystem participants                                |
| Carbon pool partnerships | Share offset management fees from verified credit mechanisms  |
| Ecosystem grants         | Eligible for public goods funding from L2 and Web3 ecosystems |

GPTX monetization avoids extractive behavior by aligning platform revenue with user success and environmental impact.
